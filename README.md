# Predicting Employee Attrition

## Overview
Employee attrition poses a significant challenge for organizations, impacting productivity, morale, and financial stability. Traditional attrition analysis methods are often subjective and time-consuming. Machine learning provides a powerful approach to predicting employee attrition by identifying key factors and trends using historical data.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict whether an employee is likely to leave a company based on various demographic, job-related, and workplace satisfaction metrics. By analyzing these factors, organizations can make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset includes employee attributes such as:
- **Demographic Information** (Age, Gender, Marital Status, etc.)
- **Job-related Factors** (Department, Job Role, Job Level, etc.)
- **Workplace Satisfaction Metrics** (Job Satisfaction, Work-Life Balance, etc.)
- **Compensation Details** (Salary, Bonus, Benefits, etc.)
- **Performance and Tenure** (Years at Company, Performance Rating, etc.)

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling and transformation
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Identifying trends and correlations
   - Visualizing key features impacting attrition
3. **Model Selection & Training**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
   - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)
4. **Evaluation & Optimization**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search/Randomized Search
   - Feature importance analysis

## Installation & Requirements
To set up the project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- XGBoost/LightGBM (for advanced modeling)

## Usage
Run the main script to train the model and make predictions:

```bash
python main.py
```

Modify hyperparameters and configurations in `config.py` for different models and settings.

## Results & Insights
The model identifies key features influencing employee attrition, helping organizations make strategic decisions to reduce turnover. Insights include:
- Employees in specific job roles are more likely to leave.
- Work-life balance and job satisfaction significantly impact attrition rates.
- Compensation and promotion frequency correlate with retention.
